We are the Porter family. My wife Brittany has celiac disease and we have been living a gluten-free lifestyle for the past three years. When it comes to gluten-free food, taste doesn't take center stage and it is often expensive. We're on a journey to find and share recipes, flours, and mixes that don't compromise on flavor or texture.
