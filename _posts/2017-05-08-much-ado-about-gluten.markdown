Have you ever bought a loaf of gluten-free bread only to be disappointed by its dry, crumbly texture? On the other hand, have you ever tried gluten-free brownies that were indistinguishable from regular brownies? Why do some recipes translate so well to gluten-free while others don't? The answer is in the name-gluten.

Gluten is a network of several different proteins that bind together with kneading. As you knead bread, the gluten networks that you form are what help trap CO<sub>2</sub> as the dough rises. The gluten networks also give bread its chewy texture. The word gluten actually comes from the Latin word for glue.

The problem, and the advantage, to gluten-free baking is the lack of gluten. Without the gluten networks, your bread is going to have a hard time trapping that CO<sub>2</sub> and developing a chewy texture. Conversely, something like pie crust which should be flaky, not chewy, doesn't need gluten. Gluten-free brownies often turn out so tasty because they also don't need the chewy gluten network.

To help mimic the gluten networks, gluten-free breads and flour mixes will often utilize xanthan gum to help give the final product a more chewy texture. Unfortunately, there are so many different flour mixes out there that each behave differently. This results in quite a bit of trial and error to end up with an end product you are happy with. We should say expensive trial and error because gluten-free flour mixes generally cost three to four times as much as regular flour.

With that being said, we are here to do all the work so that you don't have to. In coming posts, we'll be comparing and contrasting different gluten-free flour mixes to find the best flour for the recipe. Weâ€™ll be sharing our favorite mixes, tips, and tricks to make sure no one associates your gluten-free baking with flavor-free baking.
