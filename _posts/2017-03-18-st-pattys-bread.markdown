It's hard to find a good gluten-free bread mix at a low cost. The brand [Gluten-Free Heaven](https://www.glutenfreeheaven.com/) does not disappoint. We came across them at the Salt Lake Gluten-Free Expo and have tried several of their products since. For our St. Patrick's Day bread, we used their [white bread mix](https://www.glutenfreeheaven.com/collections/baking-mixes/products/gluten-free-white-bread-mix?variant=1128845721) (with some added food coloring ;) ).

The bread turned out amazing! It was moist, soft, didn't fall apart, and had a nice crust. It was by far the best packaged bread mix we've ever used.

Do you want to know the best part? Not only do they ship, but the prices are fantastic! It only costs $4.49 for the mix, which is cheaper than most pre-made gluten-free bread. If you haven't given them a look, we highly recommend them.
