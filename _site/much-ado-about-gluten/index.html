Have you ever bought a loaf of gluten-free bread only to be disappointed by its dry, crumbly texture? On the other hand, have you ever tried gluten-free brownies that were indistinguishable from regular brownies? Why do some recipes translate so well to gluten-free while others don’t? The answer is in the name-gluten.</p>

<p>Gluten is a network of several different proteins that bind together with kneading. As you knead bread, the gluten networks that you form are what help trap CO<sub>2</sub> as the dough rises. The gluten networks also give bread its chewy texture. The word gluten actually comes from the Latin word for glue.</p>

<p>The problem, and the advantage, to gluten-free baking is the lack of gluten. Without the gluten networks, your bread is going to have a hard time trapping that CO<sub>2</sub> and developing a chewy texture. Conversely, something like pie crust which should be flaky, not chewy, doesn’t need gluten. Gluten-free brownies often turn out so tasty because they also don’t need the chewy gluten network.</p>

<p>To help mimic the gluten networks, gluten-free breads and flour mixes will often utilize xanthan gum to help give the final product a more chewy texture. Unfortunately, there are so many different flour mixes out there that each behave differently. This results in quite a bit of trial and error to end up with an end product you are happy with. We should say expensive trial and error because gluten-free flour mixes generally cost three to four times as much as regular flour.</p>

<p>With that being said, we are here to do all the work so that you don’t have to. In coming posts, we’ll be comparing and contrasting different gluten-free flour mixes to find the best flour for the recipe. We’ll be sharing our favorite mixes, tips, and tricks to make sure no one associates your gluten-free baking with flavor-free baking.</p>

<p>Do you have any tips or tricks for gluten-free baking? Is there a particular flour mix that gives you good results? Let us know and we’ll be sure to try them out!</p>
